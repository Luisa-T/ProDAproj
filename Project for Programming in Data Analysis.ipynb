    "The following will investigate absenteeism at work in customer support, using the following four variables: Day of the Week, Education, Owner of a pet, and Shift Work.\n",
    "I got the idea for this from the following:\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00445/\n",
    "but I am using different significant variables. The data could be connected in one of the multinational companies which require shift work especially shift work in the sense that the employee would work a normal day shift for 4 weeks and then from 16:00 to midnight. Several studies suggest that unregular shiftwork has a negative impact on the health of employees, specifically they have a higher chance to get DiabetesII, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, depression, ulcers, and sleep problems.  [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "The day of the week seems to also have an inpact on the levels odf absenteeism. The levels of absence seem to be related to the day of week; Monday tends to have the most absences and Friday either the least or the same level as Mondays depending on the study; the researcher referred to their index as the \"Blue Monday syndrome\" [5, 6, 7].\n",
    "The level of education also seems to have an impact of the level of absenteeism in that the higher a person is educated the less days of absence they have [8]\n",
    "Several studies suggest that being a pet owner is beneficial to the person's health and also significantly reduces stress [9,10]."
