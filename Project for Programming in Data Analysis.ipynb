    "Several studies suggest that unregular shiftwork has a negative impact on the health of employees, specifically they have a higher chance to get Diabetes II, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, depression, ulcers, and sleep problems.  [1, 2, 3, 4] This would be a boolean variable, meaning either the person does shiftwork or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The day of the week seems to also have an inpact on the levels odf absenteeism. The levels of absence seem to be related to the day of week; Monday tends to have the most absences and Friday either the least or the same level as Mondays depending on the study; the researcher referred to their index as the \"Blue Monday syndrome\" [5, 6, 7]. Across the week the research suggests that there may be a distribution where two peaks are observed so in this case a bimodal distribution with an inverse bell shape would be most appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of education also seems to have an impact of the level of absenteeism in that the higher a person is educated the less days of absence they have [8]. The variable would be divided into no formal education, leaving certificate, Batchelor, Master, Doctorate. For this an exponential distribution would make most sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies suggest that being a pet owner is beneficial to the person's health and also significantly reduces stress [9,10].  Here we have another boolean variable. It could be subdivided into which pet the person has but I do not think it is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of relations between the variables, I would think that shiftwork would go together with lower education and Mondays and Fridays being the most likely days the person calls in sick. I would also suggest that pet ownership may be negatively related to this in the sense that a person doing shiftwork being less likely to have a pet and also that pet owners would be less likely to be sick on Mondays and Fridays compared to non-pet owners."

Several chronic health conditions are more prevalent in shift workers, such as heart conditions, sleep problems, diabetes, and ulcers to name a few. This then would have an impact on the level of absenteeism, whether due to illness or due to calling in sick without being sick. The level of absenteeism is also associated with the day of the week. Mondays and Fridays are the most popular days to be absent from work."
